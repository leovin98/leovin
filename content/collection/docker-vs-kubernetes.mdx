# Docker vs Kubernetes: What’s the Difference?

If you’ve ever wondered “What’s the difference between Docker and Kubernetes?” you’re not alone! These two tools are often mentioned together, but they solve different problems.

Think of Docker as the box that holds your app, and Kubernetes as the system that manages all those boxes. Let’s break it down step by step.

# Docker: Builds and Runs Your App

Docker is a tool that creates containers. A container is like a box that holds your app and everything it needs to run. For example you have an online store app. With Docker, you can pack the app together with its database, libraries, and settings. So it will run the same way on any computer.

In short, Docker helps developers make sure an app works anywhere.

# Kubernetes: Manages Many Containers

Now imagine you have hundreds of containers running different apps. Managing them one by one would be a mess. That’s where Kubernetes helps. It organizes, monitors, and balances all containers automatically.

For example big companies like Netflix or Shopee run many services at once. Kubernetes makes sure all containers run smoothly and adds more capacity when user traffic increases.

In short, Kubernetes is the manager that organizes and runs your containers.

# Example: Simple Dockerfile and Kubernetes Deployment

## Step 1: Create a simple app

Example: a small web server using Python.

Create a file called app.py:

```python
from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def hello():
    return "Hello from Docker and Kubernetes!"

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=5000)
```

## Step 2: Create a Dockerfile

This file tells Docker how to build the container.

Create a file named Dockerfile:

```bash
# Use a Python base image
FROM python:3.9

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy app code to the container
COPY app.py /app

# Install dependencies
RUN pip install flask

# Tell Docker how to run the app
CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```

## Step 3: Build and run the Docker container

Run these commands in your terminal:

```bash
# Build the image
docker build -t myapp .

# Run the container
docker run -p 5000:5000 myapp
```

Now open your browser and go to http://localhost:5000

You’ll see: Hello from Docker and Kubernetes!

## Step 4: Use Kubernetes to manage the app

First, create a deployment file called deployment.yaml:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: myapp-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: myapp
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: myapp
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: myapp
          image: myapp
          ports:
            - containerPort: 5000
```

And a service file service.yaml:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: myapp-service
spec:
  type: NodePort
  selector:
    app: myapp
  ports:
    - port: 5000
      targetPort: 5000
      nodePort: 30007
```

## Step 5: Deploy it on Kubernetes

Assuming you have kubectl and minikube installed:

```bash
# Start Kubernetes cluster
minikube start

# Deploy the app
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f service.yaml

# Check the service
kubectl get services

# Run the service
minikube service myapp-service
```

Minikube will automatically find the NodePort of your service, and then open your default web browser.

If the browser doesn’t open automatically, you can copy the URL that Minikube shows in the terminal and paste it into your browser manually.

You’ll see the same message, but now it’s running in Kubernetes and with 3 replicas automatically managed.
